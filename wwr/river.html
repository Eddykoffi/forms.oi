            Whitewater rafting and rafting are outdoor leisure pursuits that include navigating a river or other body of water on an inflatable raft. On whitewater or waters with varying degrees of roughness, this is frequently done. Risk management is frequently an element of the experience.

Since the 1950s, if not earlier, this activity has gained popularity as an adventure sport, changing from individuals paddling single-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars, to multi-person rafts propelled by double-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern.
Like all outdoor activities, rafting must balance its use of nature with the conservation of rivers as a natural resource and habitat. Because of these issues, some rivers now have regulations restricting the annual seasons and daily operating times or numbers of rafters.

Conflicts have arisen when commercial rafting operators, often in co-operation with municipalities and tourism associations, alter the riverbed by dredging and/or blasting in order to eliminate safety hazards or create more interesting whitewater features in the river. Environmentalists argue that this may have negative impacts to riparian and aquatic ecosystems, while proponents claim these measures are usually only temporary since a riverbed is naturally subject to permanent changes during large floods and other events. Another conflict involves the distribution of scarce river permits to either the do-it-yourself public or commercial rafting companies.[17]

Rafting by do-it-yourself rafters and commercial rafting companies contributes to the economy of many regions which in turn may contribute to the protection of rivers from hydroelectric power generation, diversion for irrigation, and other development. Additionally, white water rafting trips can promote environmentalism. Multi-day rafting trips by do-it-yourself rafters and commercial rafting companies through the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System have the potential to develop environmental stewardship and general environmental behavior. Studies suggest that environmental efficacy increases when there is an increase in the length of the trip, daily immersion, and the amount of resource education by trip participants.

While some river portions are regarded dangerous and intense for rafting, others are not as dangerous or tough. In rafting, </p>
